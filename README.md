## Syntax

### Variables

The only thing you can really do in Chad is declare variables for now.

```dart
var variable <- 0 // mutable
const constant <- "text" // immutable
```

### Output

A `print` function was added for console output. Standard library functions are added to the memory before runtime.

```dart
var x y <- 0
const z <- x
y <- "Hello, world!"
print(y)
```
